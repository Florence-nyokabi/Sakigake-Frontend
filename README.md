# MzaziConnect Dashboard
The MzaziConnect dashboard allows schools to have complete control and oversight over their operations. Schools can create an account using their own email address, phone number, and password. Once logged in, schools can easily add or remove grade levels, assign teachers to specific grades, and input parent information. This dashboard ensures that schools have the necessary tools to efficiently manage all aspects of their institution.
